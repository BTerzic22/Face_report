# An automated way to get insights from face pictures

*Did you happen to have a lot of files to go through at work, writing observations manually and loosing track on this repetitive task?*
I did. And opening pdfs one at a time in order to note what's in a specific schema is truly time consumming.

That made me want to develop an algorithm which should perform the following tasks:
-   go over the files in a given repository,
-   extract the images in those files,
-   compare them with a model to keep only the information needed,
-   process the resulting images to analyze and compile the insights,
-   offer an overview of the data.

## V1:
The actual version of the code is only working to extract insights from png images in a repository.
A new version will be realesed to work with pdf.

**Warnings**:
Potential issues.

**PS:** The program is still under development. I intend to make it more efficient, cleaner and add a sharing feature.
